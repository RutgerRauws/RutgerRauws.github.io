description: "In the Clinical Platforms team of Philips I worked on adapting an existing algorithm that is used to convert 2D greyscale images coming from medical scanners to 3D volumes. The focus of my study was on developing an efficient method to distribute the ray casting algorithm over a cluster of heterogeneous accelerators. My contribution was part of the final demonstration application used to show the capabilities of the European Union subsidised <a href=\"http://mango-project.eu/\">MANGO project</a>"
