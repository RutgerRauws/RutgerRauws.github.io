description: "Fighting climate change and injustice is the basis for everything I do.‚Å† The consequences of the climate crisis are already evident. It is impossible to find an affordable home and the gap between rich and poor is widening. These are the issues GroenLinks aims to tackle. If we don't, the planet will get increasingly warmer and our society increasingly poorer. GroenLinks is the only party that connects both green and left-wing politics. We combine idealism with decisiveness: we are successfully governing Eindhoven as the largest progressive party comprising.

As a council member I am working on creating more affordable and sustainable housing. A fairer Eindhoven for everyone."
