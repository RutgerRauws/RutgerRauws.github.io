description: "For my graduation project I successfully extended Sioux' in-house developed model-driven development tool. My contribution focused on automatically verifying state machines with hardware interlocks using the formal specification language and toolset called <a href=\"https://www.mcrl2.org/\">mCRL2</a>. Additionally, I proposed specifying interlocks using a subset of natural language called <a href=\"https://www.omg.org/spec/SBVR/About-SBVR\">SBVR</a> and implemented this as a proof of concept."
