description: "The non-profit organisation called ”Eindhoven in Beeld” collects historic and actual photo and video material of the city of Eindhoven. With over 150.000 photos on record, it is very challenging to make all this information available to the users of their website. The current website is lacking responsive and consistent design, as well as a solid architecture. On a voluntary basis I have taken on the challenge to design and develop a new website that tries to address these issues."
